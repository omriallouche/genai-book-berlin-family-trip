## Spreepark
**Description:**
Spreepark is a former amusement park located in East Berlin, which originally opened in 1969 as "Kulturpark Plänterwald." It was the only permanent amusement park in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and was a highly popular destination, attracting up to 1.7 million visitors annually. After German reunification, the park was privatized in 1991 and renamed "Spreepark" under the ownership of Norbert Witte. While new attractions were introduced and the park was modernized, it soon faced severe financial difficulties, declining visitor numbers, and mounting debt, leading to its closure in 2002. Witte's involvement in criminal activities, including cocaine smuggling, further contributed to the park's demise.

Following its closure, Spreepark became an iconic abandoned "lost place," drawing urban explorers and filmmakers to its decaying rides and structures. In 2014, the city of Berlin purchased the site, and since 2016, Grün Berlin, a state-owned open space developer, has been overseeing its comprehensive redevelopment. The vision for the new Spreepark is to create a sustainable public park that integrates art, culture, and nature, moving away from its past as a traditional amusement park. The redevelopment is being implemented in phases, with central areas anticipated to be completed by 2026. Key aspects include the reopening of the historic Eierhäuschen (a restaurant and art venue) and the restoration of the iconic Ferris wheel, which will be reinstalled as an artistic intervention. Other original structures are being repurposed into cultural and event spaces, with sustainability as a core principle.

## AquaDom Berlin & Sea Life Berlin
**Description:**
The AquaDom Berlin was a remarkable cylindrical acrylic glass aquarium, standing 25 meters (82 ft) tall, located within the Radisson Collection Hotel in the DomAquarée complex. Opened in December 2003 or 2004, it was once considered the world's largest cylindrical aquarium, holding 1 million liters (260,000 US gallons) of saltwater and housing approximately 1,500 tropical fish from over 100 species. A unique and captivating feature was its built-in transparent elevator, which allowed visitors to ascend directly through the center of the aquarium, offering an immersive 360-degree view of the marine life.

Tragically, the AquaDom ruptured and collapsed on December 16, 2022, causing significant damage and the loss of most of its fish. It has since been replaced by a vertical indoor garden, and there are no plans for its rebuilding. However, Sea Life Berlin, situated in the same DomAquarée complex, continues to operate as a marine sanctuary. It offers an immersive journey through various aquatic ecosystems, spanning 1800 to 2000 square meters and housing over 5,000 aquatic creatures across 37 freshwater and saltwater tanks. Visitors can explore diverse habitats, from the local River Spree to the depths of the Atlantic and vibrant tropical waters.

Key attractions at Sea Life Berlin include an Ocean Tunnel where sharks and rays swim overhead, a mesmerizing Jellyfish Invasion exhibit, and interactive Touch Pools, providing hands-on experiences with marine life. The attraction also features an Amazon Rainforest section and offers educational presentations, feeding sessions, and workshops focused on ocean conservation. Sea Life Berlin reopened after a temporary closure following the AquaDom collapse, continuing to provide an engaging and educational experience for visitors interested in marine biology and conservation.
