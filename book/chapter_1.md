# Chapter 1: Gate of Whispers

The air that greeted Noa as she stepped out of the taxi in Berlin was different. It was warm, yes, just like the August air in Tel Aviv, but it smelled of something else entirely—a mix of cool stone, sweet-scented trees, and something that tickled her nose like fizzy water. The sun, a friendly, buttery yellow, felt like it had no plans to go anywhere, even though it was already late in the afternoon.

“See, Noa?” said Dad, stretching his arms wide. “Plenty of daylight left for adventures! It’s not like home where the sun punches a clock.”

Noa smiled. She was eight years old, and adventures were her favorite food group. Her parents, who she called Ima and Abba, said she had an old soul because she was polite and a little bit too smart for her own good, but really, she was just curious about everything.

They were standing in a huge, wide-open square called Pariser Platz. In front of them stood the biggest gate Noa had ever seen. It was massive, with tall columns holding up a chariot and horses on top, all looking grand and important.

“That, my little explorer,” said Ima, pointing, “is the Brandenburg Gate. It’s been watching over Berlin for a very long time.”

As her parents took pictures, Noa wandered a little closer, her sneakers scuffing on the cobblestones. That’s when she saw him. A sleek tuxedo cat, black with a perfect white bib and paws, was sitting near the base of one of the columns, washing a single white whisker with intense focus.

Noa knelt down, as she always did with cats. “Shalom,” she whispered in Hebrew.

The cat stopped washing. It looked directly at her with startling green eyes and said, in a voice that sounded like gravel and velvet, “*Willkommen, Große Zauberin.*”

Noa blinked. She understood the words—*Welcome, Great Magician*—because Ima had been teaching her some German. But the part that made her brain feel like it had tripped was that a cat had said them.

“You… you can talk?” she stammered.

The cat gave a slow, regal blink. “Of course. The question is, you can hear.” It stood, stretched its front paws, and gave a little bow. “We have been waiting.”

“Waiting for what?” Noa asked, her heart doing a little pitter-pat of excitement.

“For you, of course,” the cat said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “The fog… it grows thicker when the city forgets how to listen.”

Before Noa could ask what fog, her dad called her over. “Noa, come on! Let’s get a picture.”

She looked back at the cat, but it was gone. Had she imagined it? She shook her head. It felt too real. As she stood between her parents for the photo, she looked down at the cobblestones. They were a bit dusty. On an impulse, she focused on one stone at her feet and whispered the first magic word that popped into her head: “*Metzutzach*.” It was Hebrew for ‘polished.’

A tiny shimmer, like heat haze, danced over the stone. When it faded, the single cobblestone gleamed, its surface so clean it reflected the blue sky like a tiny mirror.

“Wow,” Noa breathed.

“What’s wow?” asked Ima, looking down.

“That stone! I cleaned it… with a word!”

Dad crouched down and squinted at it. “It is very clean, sweetie. Maybe a street cleaner just went by.” He ruffled her hair. “Must be the jet lag making things feel a bit magical.”

Noa knew it wasn’t jet lag. It was real. And she had a feeling this was only the beginning.

Their next stop was a building with a giant glass dome on top, like a huge, glittering bubble. “The Reichstag,” Abba announced. “It’s where Germany’s government meets. We’re going all the way to the top.”

As they waited in line, a little terrier with a wiry coat and an important-looking beard trotted past. It stopped, sniffed the air, and then looked right at Noa.

“You’re the one the cats were talking about,” it yapped, its tail giving a single, sharp wag. “Good. You’re here. The fog is getting worse, you know. It rises when the city forgets to listen.”

There was that word again. *Fog*. “What fog?” Noa asked, trying to look like she was just admiring the dog.

“The quiet fog,” the terrier said, its voice dropping. “The one that smudges stories and muffles memories. You have to be careful. It’s sneaky.”

“Noa, who are you talking to?” Ima asked gently.

“Just saying hello to the dog,” Noa said quickly. The terrier gave a little nod and trotted off, disappearing into the crowd.

Inside, they walked up a long, spiraling ramp inside the glass dome. The whole of Berlin spread out below them like a giant map. Noa could see a huge green park, a winding river, and buildings of all shapes and sizes. It was beautiful. Her dad bought a big, soft pretzel, and they shared it as they looked out the window.

Noa remembered what the cat and the dog had said about listening and fog. She wanted to see this fog. She needed clarity. She held a crumb of pretzel in her palm, closed her eyes, and whispered a word she felt described her wish: “*Behirut*.” Clarity.

She opened her eyes. Nothing looked different. But then, Abba yelped.

“What in the world?”

The pretzel crumbs on his shirt had lifted into the air. They were floating, orbiting his head in a slow, lazy circle like tiny, salty satellites. A woman standing nearby gasped. A security guard frowned, looking completely baffled.

“Abba, hold still!” Noa whispered, trying not to giggle.

Dad, to his credit, just looked amazed. “Is this… static electricity?” he wondered aloud, slowly reaching out a finger to poke a floating crumb. It bobbed away from his touch.

Panicked, Noa waved her hands in a shushing motion. “Go away!” she mouthed at the crumbs. They immediately dropped, dusting his shoulders and the floor.

The security guard shook his head and walked away, muttering in German.

“Well,” said Ima, brushing the crumbs off Dad’s shirt. “That was… unusual.”

Dad was grinning. “I felt like a planet! A very tasty planet.” He looked at Noa, a twinkle in his eye. “You have some very interesting jet lag, my dear.”

Noa knew it wasn’t jet lag. It was magic. And it was messy.

***

The huge green park they had seen from the dome was called the Tiergarten. Ima called it “the city’s green lung,” and it felt like it. The air was fresh and smelled of damp earth and roses. The late afternoon sun sent long, golden shafts of light through the leaves. It was much bigger than any park Noa had been to in Tel Aviv.

As her parents found a bench in a rose garden, Noa followed a winding path deeper into the trees. She saw a flash of red fur, then another. A family of squirrels was chittering on a low-hanging branch. When they saw her, they fell silent.

One, a brave-looking squirrel with a very bushy tail, scampered down the trunk. It scurried over to her, dropped something at her feet, and then scurried back to its family. They all watched her, their little black eyes bright with expectation.

On the ground was a twig. It was perfectly straight, about as long as her forearm, with smooth bark and a tiny, hopeful leaf at its tip. It looked like a wand.

Noa picked it up. It felt warm and right in her hand.

“For me?” she asked softly.

The squirrels chittered in agreement. The brave one added, in a squeaky voice that sounded like rustling leaves, “A tool. To help you listen. But be polite with it.”

Noa nodded seriously. She’d already made pretzel crumbs fly and polished a rock. She understood that this magic needed a gentle hand. “I promise,” she said to the squirrels. “I’ll practice. I won’t show off.”

She held the twig wand and felt a little hum of energy from it, a quiet thrum that seemed to connect her to the trees, the ground, and the whole, vast, listening park. She was Noa, she was eight, and she was on vacation. But she was also, apparently, a magician. And she had a mission.

As the sun began to dip lower, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, she heard it. A faint sound, carried on the breeze from far away, a chorus of voices she now recognized. It was the cats of Berlin, and they were singing.

“*The fog remembers…*”
