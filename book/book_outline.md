## **Working Title**

**“Noa and the Meow-gicians of Berlin”** _Logline:_ Noa, 8, from Tel Aviv, lands in Berlin and discovers the city’s cats and dogs can talk to her alone. They insist she’s a “great magician” destined to dispel a creeping shadow-fog. Her spells often misfire, but kindness, wit, and hard work turn slip-ups into solutions.

## **Day 1 — Brandenburg Gate → Reichstag → Tiergarten**

**Chapter 1: “Gate of Whispers”** **Plot beats**

- Arrival at **Brandenburg Gate**; a tuxedo cat calls Noa “Große Zauberin.” A small spell only polishes the cobblestones. Parents hear nothing, assume jet lag.

- A terrier near **Reichstag** hints at a “fog” rising if Berlin forgets to listen. In the glass dome, Noa tries a “clarity” charm; it makes pretzel crumbs orbit Dad.

- In **Tiergarten**, squirrels bow and gift a twig “wand.” Noa promises to practice, not show off.

**Facts to weave**

- August = warm T-shirt days, late sunsets after \~20:30; great playground time.

- Berlin vs Tel Aviv: longer daylight, hat-wearing **Ampelmännchen** at crossings.

- Tiergarten hides multiple playgrounds; rose-garden scents; “city’s green lung.”

**Value/theme:** Trust your own perception; stay polite and observant.

## **Day 2 — TV Tower → Nikolaiviertel → Museum Island → Gendarmenmarkt (Chocolate)**

**Chapter 2: “The Tower and the Wiggly Spaghetti-Ice”** **Plot beats**

- **Nikolaiviertel** stroll; street cats point toward a “library of statues” (Museum Island).

- On **Museum Island**, Noa practices saying “Bitte/Danke”; statues “lean in” to listen. Finish with **Rausch Schokoladenhaus** praline “fuel.”

**Facts to weave**

- TV-Tower = Germany’s tallest (368 m); sphere can show a cross (“Pope’s Revenge”).

- Linden-scented boulevard; fountains mist at Lustgarten; ice-cream “permission slips.”

**Value/theme:** Politeness is universal magic.

***


## **Day 3 — LEGOLAND Discovery Centre → Technikmuseum & Spectrum (+ Park am Gleisdreieck)**

**Chapter 3: “Bricks, Bots, and a Friendly Plane”** **Plot beats**

- At **LEGOLAND**, Noa conjures a brick-dragon that sneezes confetti; kids collaborate to “debug” it into a mosaic clue.

- At **Deutsches Technikmuseum** and **Science Center Spectrum**, her “hover” charm only lifts paper planes; the C-47 on the roof “winks” in approval when she solves a puzzle by reading the exhibit notes.

- **Gleisdreieck Park**: a spaniel explains the shadow-fog feeds on hurriedness; they time a breath-and-balance game on old rail beams.

**Facts to weave**

- LEGOLAND’s MINILAND, rides, 4D cinema; family hit.

- Technikmuseum’s aviation hall + Spectrum \~150 experiments; park next door.

- Gleisdreieck “old rails” balancing beams.

**Value/theme:** Hard work + curiosity > flashy spells.

- **Mauerpark** flea market and music; her rhythm spell makes buckets drum along; crowd laughs.

- **MACHmit!**: in the wooden maze, she learns focus beats haste (parents join printing press fun).

**Facts to weave**

## **Day 5 — Checkpoint Charlie → Markthalle Neun → East Side Gallery → Holzmarkt**

**Chapter 5: “Passports, Pretzels, and Painted Walls”** **Plot beats**

- **Checkpoint Charlie**: a beagle “guard” teaches Noa a gateway-spell; her first try only stamps everyone’s noses with tiny stars.

- **Markthalle Neun** lunch; a dachshund chef hints “real magic tastes like sharing.”

- **East Side Gallery**: Noa’s color-mend spell restores a fading mural ribbon; fog recoils.

- **Holzmarkt** riverside; she practices slow-magic while parents relax by the Spree.

**Facts to weave**

- Market hall 1891; sustainable foods; Thursday is street-food night (context).

- East Side Gallery = 1.3 km of post-Wall murals; Oberbaumbrücke nearby.

- In **Charlottenburg Gardens**, a swan family escorts Noa; her “time-slow” charm backfires into slow-motion giggles.

- She deciphers that the final fog-knot hides where water, trees, and stone “remember.”

**Facts to weave**

- Berlin has _more bridges than Venice_—spot them en route; city bear on manhole covers = luck tap.

- Park etiquette and calm—Berlin’s quieter Sundays vs Tel Aviv’s Friday rhythm.

- Late-summer weather remains mild; cobblestones prefer sneakers.

**Value/theme:** Patience and respect for place.

***


## **Day 8 — Natural History Museum → Free Afternoon / Street-Food Evening**

**Chapter 8: “Night of the Kindly Giants — Finale”** **Plot beats**

- **Museum für Naturkunde**: by Tristan the T-Rex, Noa’s steady “together” spell invites kids, parents, and animals to hum one beat; the shadow-fog unspools like dust in sunlight.

- Parents _almost_ hear a cat say “Danke,” finally believing _something_ special happened.

- Evening street-food stroll: Noa trades her twig-wand for a bottle-deposit trick, showing any kid can “save a city” one small action at a time.
