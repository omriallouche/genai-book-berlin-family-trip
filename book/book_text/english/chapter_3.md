# Chapter 3: Bricks, Bots, and a Friendly Plane

If there was one place in Berlin that felt like it was built by magicians, it was LEGOLAND Discovery Centre. The next morning, Noa stood in a room called MINILAND, where the entire city of Berlin was recreated in miniature LEGO bricks. There was the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, and even the TV Tower, all built from millions of tiny plastic blocks.

“I could live here,” Noa declared.

Her mission today was to practice her magic in a place full of creativity. She figured that if she could make a stone gleam and ice cream wiggle, maybe she could bring some LEGOs to life. She found a quiet corner with a pile of loose bricks and began to build. She decided to make a dragon, a friendly one, to be her helper.

She built a long green body, yellow wings, and big, googly eyes. When she was done, she held her twig wand over it and whispered, “*Chaim*.” Life.

For a second, nothing happened. Then, the little brick dragon twitched. Its head lifted, and it let out a tiny, silent roar. Noa beamed. It worked!

But then, the dragon’s mouth opened wide, and it sneezed. A huge cloud of colorful confetti, which had been part of a nearby LEGO party display, erupted from its mouth, showering a group of kids who were building a castle.

The kids gasped, then burst out laughing. Confetti rained down on them like magical dust. Dad, who had been taking a selfie, ended up with a beard of red and blue confetti.

“Gesundheit!” he chuckled, picking confetti out of his hair.

Noa’s dragon looked pleased with itself, but it had ruined the other kids’ castle. “Oh no,” Noa said, rushing over. “I’m so sorry! My… uh… dragon is a bit mischievous.”

The other kids weren’t upset. They were delighted. “It’s a confetti dragon!” one boy shouted.

Instead of being a disaster, it became a game. Noa showed them how the dragon had a loose brick in its neck. Together, they “debugged” it, securing the brick. Then, using the fallen confetti, they worked together to create a beautiful mosaic on the floor. When they were done, the pattern of the confetti formed a perfect, shimmering arrow.

“Look!” said a girl with pigtails. “It’s pointing somewhere.”

Noa looked. The arrow was pointing directly at a picture on the wall—a picture of an old-fashioned airplane.

***

The arrow, it turned out, was pointing them to their next destination: the German Museum of Technology, the Deutsches Technikmuseum. The place was enormous. It had trains, boats, and cars, but the best part was the aviation hall. Real airplanes, big and small, were suspended from the ceiling as if frozen in flight.

High up on the roof of the building, visible through a skylight, was a real C-47 airplane, a famous type of plane that brought supplies to Berlin during a time called the Airlift. Noa thought it looked brave and kind.

She wanted to try a hovering spell. She found a quiet exhibit with paper airplanes and laid one on her palm. “*Lekhulel*,” she whispered, a word for hover she’d made up.

It worked! The paper plane lifted gently from her hand and floated in the air, bobbing on an invisible current. She made another one float, and then another, until she had a little squadron of paper planes circling her head like a halo. Dad tried to launch his own paper plane into her magical air-traffic control, but it just did a loop-the-loop and bopped him on the nose.

Noa giggled. She looked up at the big C-47 on the roof. She felt a sense of respect for the giant, silent plane. Just then, a draft from a vent made the C-47’s rudder move just a tiny bit. From where Noa was standing, it looked exactly like the friendly giant was giving her a slow, approving wink.

She realized then that her magic wasn’t about lifting real, heavy airplanes. It was about understanding how they worked. She found a nearby exhibit with a puzzle about aerodynamics. It was tricky, but she didn’t use magic. She just read the notes carefully, looked at the diagrams, and figured it out, piece by piece. When she finally placed the last piece in the puzzle, she felt a surge of satisfaction that was even better than floating paper planes.

Next to the technology museum was a park, but it wasn’t a normal park. It was called Park am Gleisdreieck, the “Park at the Rail Triangle,” because it was built on the site of a huge old train yard. Some of the old railway tracks were still there, running through the grassy fields like metal rivers.

As her parents found a spot to relax, Noa went to explore the tracks. A friendly-looking spaniel with long, floppy ears was trotting along one of the rails, its balance perfect.

“Hello there,” the spaniel woofed softly, hopping down to greet her. “You’re the magician. I can feel the hum.”

“You can?” Noa asked.

“Of course. I’m a master of balance,” the dog said proudly. “And balance is a kind of magic. The shadow-fog hates balance. It feeds on hurriedness and distraction. When you rush, you stumble. When you stumble, the fog gets a little thicker.”

This was the best clue she’d gotten yet. “So, if I can stay balanced…”

“…you can push it back,” the spaniel finished. “Practice with me.”

The spaniel became her coach. It showed her how to walk along the old rail beams, placing one foot carefully in front of the other. It wasn’t about speed; it was about breathing. Inhale, step. Exhale, step.

Soon, a few other kids joined in, and it became a game. Even Dad tried it, wobbling dramatically and calling himself “Tightrope Dad” as he walked along a rail that was only a few inches off the soft grass.

They didn’t banish any fog, not that Noa could see. But as they all played together, laughing and concentrating, the air felt clearer, lighter. Noa looked down the long, straight line of the track. At the very end, someone had drawn a chalk arrow on the pavement. It was pointing north, toward a part of the city she hadn’t seen yet.

And the arrow was pointing toward a drawing of a wall.
