# Chapter 2: The Tower and the Wiggly Spaghetti-Ice

The next morning, Noa woke up to the smell of fresh bread and the sound of a strange, two-toned siren in the distance. The twig wand was on her bedside table, and for a moment, she wondered if yesterday had been a dream. But then she remembered the gleaming cobblestone, the floating pretzel crumbs, and the squirrels’ serious little faces. It was real.

Today’s plan was to go up the tallest building in Germany. “The Fernsehturm,” Dad had announced at breakfast, which meant “television tower.”

From the ground, it looked like a giant needle poking the sky, with a huge silver ball stuck near the top. The elevator ride was so fast it made Noa’s ears pop. As they ascended, she decided to test her magic again, but this time, she’d be more careful. She wanted to create a shield, something to protect her from the strange “fog” the animals kept mentioning. She held her new wand under her jacket, closed her eyes, and whispered, “*Magen*.” Shield.

She didn’t feel any different, but when the elevator doors opened, her hair was standing straight up, crackling with static electricity. A little boy pointed at her and giggled.

“Goodness, Noa,” said Ima, trying to smooth it down. “You’re a little lightning rod!”

Noa took a deep breath, remembering what the squirrels had said about being polite and listening. She focused on calming the fizzing energy inside her. Slowly, her hair settled back down. Her mom looked impressed. “Good job, sweetie. Taking a deep breath always helps.”

From the observation deck, Berlin was a breathtaking map. Noa could see everything. She spotted the green expanse of the Tiergarten where she’d gotten her wand, and the glass dome of the Reichstag. She also saw a wide, straight boulevard lined with linden trees, and a cluster of important-looking buildings on an island in the middle of the river Spree.

“That’s Unter den Linden,” said Dad, pointing. “And that’s Museum Island. A library of statues, you could say.”

Noa’s ears perked up. A “library of statues” was exactly what the street cats had told her to find. She looked closely, tracing the path of the river, the green of the parks, and the stone of the buildings. Water, trees, stone. The three things she’d seen from the Reichstag dome, forming a giant triangle across the city. She had a feeling it was important.

Later, they strolled through a neighborhood called the Nikolaiviertel. It felt like stepping back in time. The streets were narrow and cobbled, and the buildings were old and charming. As her parents admired a church, Noa saw a group of cats lounging in a patch of sun. A fluffy ginger one opened one eye and flicked an ear toward the river.

“The library of statues awaits, *Große Zauberin*,” it murmured, its voice a lazy purr. “They listen well. But you must be polite.”

“*Danke*,” Noa whispered back, giving a little bow. Thank you.

Her parents wanted to walk along the grand boulevard, Unter den Linden. The air smelled sweet from the lime trees. They passed a big green space called the Lustgarten, where fountains sent a cool mist into the air. And there it was: Museum Island, a whole island packed with grand, stony buildings.

Noa didn’t know which museum to start with, so she just stood on the lawn, her wand tucked in her pocket. She remembered the cat’s advice. Politeness was magic. She looked at the nearest grand building, the Altes Museum, with its tall columns, and said softly, “*Bitte schön*.” You’re welcome, or Here you go.

It was a silly thing to say to a building, but as the words left her lips, something amazing happened. A flock of pigeons that had been pecking randomly at the grass suddenly organized themselves. They formed a perfectly straight, orderly queue, as if waiting to buy tickets. A moment later, the spell broke, and they scattered in a flutter of wings.

Noa giggled. This magic was tricky.

She tried again, this time just thinking the words. *Hello. You look very important. May I please have your attention?*

It felt like the whole island sighed. The statues on the rooftops seemed to lean in just a fraction, their stone faces turned toward her, listening. She didn’t hear any voices, but she felt a deep, ancient quiet, a sense of stories held within the stone.

“What are you thinking about so hard?” Ima asked, sitting beside her on a bench.

“Just… listening,” Noa said. And it was true.

***

All that listening made a magician hungry. Dad declared it was time for a treat. He led them to a shop that smelled like heaven. It was called Rausch Schokoladenhaus, a whole house dedicated to chocolate. There were huge sculptures made of chocolate—the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, even a chocolate airplane.

“This is your kind of museum, eh, Noa?” Dad joked.

They sat at a small café upstairs. Her parents ordered coffee, but Dad insisted Noa try a Berlin specialty: Spaghetti-Eis. When it arrived, Noa stared. It looked exactly like a plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce and parmesan cheese, but it was made of ice cream! Vanilla ice cream was pushed through a press to make the “noodles,” strawberry sauce was the “tomato sauce,” and white chocolate shavings were the “cheese.”

It was the funniest dessert she had ever seen. As she lifted her spoon, she remembered her manners. “*Bitte*,” she said to the ice cream, feeling a bit silly.

And the ice cream wiggled.

Just a little bit, but the vanilla noodles definitely jiggled on their own. Noa froze, her spoon halfway to her mouth. She glanced at her parents. They hadn’t noticed.

She tried again, whispering it this time. “*Bitte*.”

The spaghetti-ice gave a more enthusiastic wiggle, the strawberry sauce sloshing gently.

Noa couldn’t help it. A giggle escaped. She had so much to learn. This magic was powerful, but it was also playful. She took a big bite of the ice cream. It was delicious. It tasted like victory.

As they left the chocolate house, their spirits high and their bellies full of sugar, Noa felt a new sense of confidence. She might not be able to fight a mysterious fog yet, but she could make pigeons form a queue and spaghetti-ice dance. And that was a start.

She looked back towards Museum Island. A bronze lion on a nearby bridge seemed to catch her eye. She couldn’t be sure, but she thought she heard a low, rumbling whisper on the wind, a secret just for her.

“*The fog feeds on hurry. But it fears a happy heart.*”
