# Chapter 7: The Palace of Quiet Footsteps

The next day was a quiet day. Dad said that Sundays in Berlin were for relaxing, not for rushing around. Their plan was to visit Charlottenburg Palace and its huge, beautiful gardens. The swan feather on Noa’s bedside table reminded her of the message: *patience*.

The palace was grand and golden, but it was the gardens that felt truly magical. There were long, straight paths lined with trees, a sparkling lake, and perfectly trimmed hedges that formed a maze. It was a place for strolling, not running.

As they walked towards the lake, a family of swans glided over to the shore. They weren’t just any swans; they were the most elegant, regal birds Noa had ever seen. They seemed to be escorting her, their long necks held high.

Noa felt the urge to try a big, impressive spell. Maybe she could make the fountains dance, or the flowers bloom out of season. But she remembered the swan’s message. Patience. So instead, she decided to try a very small, very slow spell. She wanted to slow down time itself, just for a moment, to make the peaceful afternoon last longer.

She held her twig wand and whispered, “*Le’at*.” Slowly.

The effect was not what she expected. Time didn’t slow down for the whole park, just for her and her parents. Suddenly, they were all moving in hilarious slow motion. Dad, who had been in the middle of a big step, seemed to hang in the air for a full five seconds before his foot landed. Ima, who was pointing at a statue, moved her arm with the syrupy slowness of an astronaut in space.

Noa tried to walk, but her legs felt like they were moving through invisible honey. She looked at her parents. They looked back at her, their faces frozen in surprise, and then they all burst out laughing. Their laughter, too, was deep and slow, like a record playing at the wrong speed.

“Noa,” Dad boomed in his slow-motion voice, “what… did… you… do?”

“I think I broke time!” she giggled back, her voice a low warble.

It was the funniest magic mishap yet. Dad started narrating their walk in a slow, dramatic voice, making a simple stroll to a bench sound like an epic journey. Noa finally found the right mental command—“*Kadima*,” forward—and with a little pop, the bubble of slow time burst, and they were all moving at normal speed again, collapsing onto a bench in a fit of giggles.

***

When their laughter subsided, a peaceful quiet settled over them. They sat on the bench, looking out over the lake. Noa’s parents weren’t skeptical anymore. They were co-investigators.

“Okay,” Dad said, turning to her with a serious expression. “The cats at the East Side Gallery said the final knots of the fog are hidden where water, trees, and stone remember. What does that mean?”

Noa pulled out the city map they had picked up. “I think I’ve seen it,” she said, her voice full of excitement. “From the TV Tower, remember? I saw a triangle across the city. The river is the water. The Tiergarten is the trees. And Museum Island is the stone.”

She traced the three points on the map. They formed a large triangle. But where was the center? Where did they all converge?

She tried a little map-magic, tapping the center of the triangle with her wand and whispering, “Show me.”

The map just swirled with confusing lines, one of which ended up spiraling right onto Dad’s nose.

“Not again,” he sighed, wiping the ink off.

Noa realized she was trying to force the answer. Patience. She closed her eyes and thought back. She thought about all the clues. The animals. The listening. The sharing. The creativity. And then she thought about the final message from the cats: “where water, trees, and stone *remember*.”

It wasn’t just any water, trees, and stone. It was a place of memory. A place that held the oldest stories of all. Stories of the earth itself.

Her eyes flew open. “The Natural History Museum!” she exclaimed.

Her parents looked at her, confused.

“It makes perfect sense!” she explained, her words tumbling out. “It’s a hall of stone, full of ancient things that came from the water and the earth. It’s a place where giants remember. Not just any giants. The kindest giants of all. The dinosaurs!”

Dad’s eyes widened as he understood. “A hall of giants,” he breathed.

They looked at the map again. The Museum für Naturkunde, the Natural History Museum, was right there, just north of the river, not far from the main train station. It was the perfect place for the fog’s final stronghold.

They had a plan. Tomorrow, they would go to the museum. Tomorrow, they would face the fog together.

As evening fell and they made their way out of the palace gardens, a low, gentle sound drifted on the night breeze. It wasn’t a cat’s meow or a dog’s bark. It was a deep, ancient, rumbling sound, like a mountain sleeping. It was the sound of a kind giant, waiting for them.
