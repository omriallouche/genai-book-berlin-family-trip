# Chapter 2: Image Prompts

**Character Description for Chapter 2:** Noa, an 8-year-old girl with long, wavy brown-black hair and big brown eyes, is wearing a bright yellow t-shirt with a cartoon cat on it, blue jeans, and red sneakers. Her hair is a bit messy and standing on end with static. Her mom, Ima, is in a stylish green blouse and white trousers. Her dad, Abba, is wearing a blue polo shirt and khaki shorts. The style is colorful and whimsical, like a modern children's book illustration.

**Before:**
She didn’t feel any different, but when the elevator doors opened, her hair was standing straight up, crackling with static electricity. A little boy pointed at her and giggled.

**Prompt 1:**
A cute 8-year-old girl, Noa, with long dark hair standing straight up in all directions with crackling static electricity. She is wearing a yellow cat t-shirt and jeans. She looks surprised and slightly embarrassed inside a modern elevator, while her mom tries to smooth her hair down and a little boy points and giggles. The style is colorful and whimsical.

**After:**
“Goodness, Noa,” said Ima, trying to smooth it down. “You’re a little lightning rod!”

**Before:**
From the observation deck, Berlin was a breathtaking map. Noa could see everything. She spotted the green expanse of the Tiergarten where she’d gotten her wand, and the glass dome of the Reichstag. She also saw a wide, straight boulevard lined with linden trees, and a cluster of important-looking buildings on an island in the middle of the river Spree.

**Prompt 2:**
A beautiful, colorful, panoramic view of Berlin from a high observation deck (the Fernsehturm). Below is a cityscape with a winding river, a large green park (Tiergarten), and an island with grand museum buildings. An 8-year-old girl, Noa, with dark hair and brown eyes, is looking out with a sense of wonder, her face pressed against the glass.

**After:**
“That’s Unter den Linden,” said Dad, pointing. “And that’s Museum Island. A library of statues, you could say.”

**Before:**
It was a silly thing to say to a building, but as the words left her lips, something amazing happened. A flock of pigeons that had been pecking randomly at the grass suddenly organized themselves. They formed a perfectly straight, orderly queue, as if waiting to buy tickets. A moment later, the spell broke, and they scattered in a flutter of wings.

**Prompt 3:**
A comical scene in a grand European plaza (Berlin's Lustgarten). A flock of city pigeons has magically formed a perfectly straight, orderly queue. A cute 8-year-old girl, Noa, is standing nearby, giggling with her hand over her mouth, holding a small twig wand. In the background are grand museum buildings with columns. The style is colorful and whimsical.

**After:**
Noa giggled. This magic was tricky.

**Before:**
It was the funniest dessert she had ever seen. As she lifted her spoon, she remembered her manners. “*Bitte*,” she said to the ice cream, feeling a bit silly.

**Prompt 4:**
A close-up shot of a fantastical dessert called Spaghetti-Eis on a cafe table. The vanilla ice cream "noodles" are wiggling and dancing on their own, with strawberry "tomato sauce" sloshing gently. A cute 8-year-old girl, Noa, with big brown eyes, watches with a look of pure delight and astonishment, her spoon frozen mid-air. The scene is colorful and full of playful magic.

**After:**
And the ice cream wiggled.
