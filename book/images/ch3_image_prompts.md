**Before:**
But then, the dragon’s mouth opened wide, and it sneezed. A huge cloud of colorful confetti, which had been part of a nearby LEGO party display, erupted from its mouth, showering a group of kids who were building a castle.

**Prompt 1:**
A small, friendly dragon made entirely of LEGO bricks, sitting on a floor, sneezing a massive, vibrant cloud of colorful confetti. The confetti shower rains down on a group of laughing children and a surprised dad who now has a confetti beard. The scene is set in a colorful room full of LEGO creations (MINILAND). The style is bright, dynamic, and full of joy.

**After:**
The kids gasped, then burst out laughing. Confetti rained down on them like magical dust. Dad, who had been taking a selfie, ended up with a beard of red and blue confetti.

**Before:**
She wanted to try a hovering spell. She found a quiet exhibit with paper airplanes and laid one on her palm. “*Lekhulel*,” she whispered, a word for hover she’d made up.

**Prompt 2:**
A cute 8-year-old girl, Noa, with braided dark hair and wearing denim overalls, stands in a technology museum's aviation hall. She has a look of intense concentration as a squadron of paper airplanes magically floats and circles around her head like a halo. In the background, real, large airplanes are suspended from the ceiling. The scene is filled with a sense of quiet, wondrous magic.

**After:**
It worked! The paper plane lifted gently from her hand and floated in the air, bobbing on an invisible current. She made another one float, and then another, until she had a little squadron of paper planes circling her head like a halo.

**Before:**
The spaniel became her coach. It showed her how to walk along the old rail beams, placing one foot carefully in front of the other. It wasn’t about speed; it was about breathing. Inhale, step. Exhale, step.

**Prompt 3:**
A heartwarming scene in a park built on old railway tracks (Park am Gleisdreieck). A cute 8-year-old girl, Noa, is carefully balancing as she walks along a steel rail. A friendly spaniel with floppy ears trots alongside her on the grass, looking up encouragingly. In the background, her dad wobbles dramatically as he tries to balance on another rail. The atmosphere is sunny, playful, and light.

**After:**
Soon, a few other kids joined in, and it became a game. Even Dad tried it, wobbling dramatically and calling himself “Tightrope Dad” as he walked along a rail that was only a few inches off the soft grass.

**Before:**
Noa looked down the long, straight line of the track. At the very end, someone had drawn a chalk arrow on the pavement. It was pointing north, toward a part of the city she hadn’t seen yet.

**Prompt 4:**
A low-angle shot looking down a long, straight railway track embedded in a grassy park. At the end of the track, a large, colorful chalk arrow is drawn on the pavement, pointing forward. Next to the arrow is a simple chalk drawing of a wall. The sun is setting, casting long shadows and giving the scene a sense of mystery and adventure.

**After:**
And the arrow was pointing toward a drawing of a wall.
