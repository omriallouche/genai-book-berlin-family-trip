# Chapter 7: Image Prompts

**Character Description for Chapter 7:** Noa, an 8-year-old girl with long, wavy brown-black hair and big brown eyes, is dressed a bit more formally for the palace. She wears a navy blue dress with a white collar, white tights, and black patent leather shoes. Her hair is neatly combed with a matching blue headband. Her mom, Ima, is in an elegant skirt and blouse. Her dad, Abba, is wearing a blazer over a shirt. The style is elegant and whimsical, with a touch of slapstick comedy.

**Before:**
The palace was grand and golden, but it was the gardens that felt truly magical. There were long, straight paths lined with trees, a sparkling lake, and perfectly trimmed hedges that formed a maze. It was a place for strolling, not running.

**Prompt 1:**
A beautiful, serene scene in the gardens of Charlottenburg Palace. A grand, golden palace is visible in the background. In the foreground, a family of majestic white swans glides across a sparkling lake, seemingly escorting a cute 8-year-old girl, Noa, who is walking along the path with her parents. The atmosphere is peaceful, elegant, and filled with a sense of quiet magic.

**After:**
As they walked towards the lake, a family of swans glided over to the shore. They weren’t just any swans; they were the most elegant, regal birds Noa had ever seen. They seemed to be escorting her, their long necks held high.

**Before:**
The effect was not what she expected. Time didn’t slow down for the whole park, just for her and her parents. Suddenly, they were all moving in hilarious slow motion. Dad, who had been in the middle of a big step, seemed to hang in the air for a full five seconds before his foot landed.

**Prompt 2:**
A hilarious, slapstick-comedy scene in the beautiful gardens of Charlottenburg Palace. An 8-year-old girl, Noa, her mom, and her dad are all frozen in comical slow-motion poses. The dad is suspended mid-stride, one leg in the air. The mom is pointing at a statue with exaggerated slowness. Noa is trying to walk but looks like she's moving through honey. They are all starting to laugh, their faces full of surprise. The scene is sunny, elegant, and very funny.

**After:**
Ima, who was pointing at a statue, moved her arm with the syrupy slowness of an astronaut in space.

**Before:**
She traced the three points on the map. They formed a large triangle. But where was the center? Where did they all converge?

**Prompt 3:**
A scene of focused discovery. Noa and her parents are sitting on a bench in the Charlottenburg gardens. They are huddled over a large map of Berlin. Noa, looking excited, is tracing a large triangle on the map with her finger, connecting the river, a park, and an island. Her parents look on with intrigued and serious expressions, fully invested in the magical quest. The scene is about family teamwork and solving a magical puzzle together.

**After:**
She tried a little map-magic, tapping the center of the triangle with her wand and whispering, “Show me.”

**Before:**
Her eyes flew open. “The Natural History Museum!” she exclaimed.

**Prompt 4:**
A "eureka" moment. A close-up on the face of 8-year-old Noa. Her big brown eyes are wide with sudden realization and excitement. In the reflection of her eyes, we can see a faint image of a dinosaur skeleton. She has just solved the puzzle. Her parents look at her, their expressions a mixture of confusion and dawning understanding.

**After:**
Her parents looked at her, confused. “It makes perfect sense!” she explained, her words tumbling out. “It’s a hall of stone, full of ancient things that came from the water and the earth. It’s a place where giants remember. Not just any giants. The kindest giants of all. The dinosaurs!”
