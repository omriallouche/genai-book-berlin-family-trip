**Before:**
Her first attempt was… sparkly. Instead of a feeling of welcome, a tiny, shimmering, five-pointed star appeared on the tip of her nose. She looked at her parents. They had them too. So did the beagle. And the tourist standing next to them. Everyone within ten feet suddenly had a tiny, glittering star stamped on their nose.

**Prompt 1:**
A funny, sparkling scene at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin. A cute 8-year-old girl, Noa, has a look of surprise as a magical, glittering five-pointed star appears on her nose. Her parents, a serious-looking beagle, and other nearby tourists all have matching sparkly stars on their noses and are looking at each other in amused confusion. The atmosphere is lighthearted and magical.

**After:**
People started noticing, looking at each other and laughing. Soon, everyone was taking selfies with their sparkly noses. “Well, this is festive,” Ima said, examining her reflection in her phone.

**Before:**
Instead, she just did it the old-fashioned way. She broke off a piece of her pretzel and gave it to her mom. She gave another piece to her dad. She saw a little boy looking at their pretzel with wide eyes, so she asked her dad if it was okay, and then she walked over and offered him a piece too.

**Prompt 2:**
A heartwarming scene in a bustling, colorful indoor market (Markthalle Neun). A cute 8-year-old girl, Noa, is offering a piece of her giant pretzel to a small, shy boy. Her parents look on with proud smiles. In the background, a small dachshund with an important air watches them approvingly. The market is full of people and delicious-looking food stalls, creating a warm, happy atmosphere.

**After:**
The boy’s mom smiled at her, a big, warm, grateful smile.

**Before:**
She started to hum. It was the beat from the bucket drummers in the park. She held her wand like a conductor’s baton and traced the shape of the ribbon in the air, humming louder. She poured all her feelings into the sound—her love for the beautiful painting, her anger at the ugly fog, her hope for the city.

**Prompt 3:**
A powerful and magical moment at the East Side Gallery. An 8-year-old girl, Noa, stands before a famous mural of a colorful ribbon, which is being dulled by a patch of gray fog. She holds a twig wand like a conductor's baton, her eyes closed in concentration as she hums. Glowing threads of red, blue, and yellow lift from the painting, weaving around her wand, preparing to fight the fog. The scene is dramatic and full of vibrant color and emotion.

**After:**
And the color answered.

**Before:**
She aimed her wand at the wall and sent the colors streaming back into the mural. They hit the concrete with a soft *hiss*, and where they landed, the fog vanished. It didn’t just fade; it recoiled, pulling back from the vibrant, living color as if it had been burned.

**Prompt 4:**
A triumphant, beautiful scene at the East Side Gallery. A brave 8-year-old girl, Noa, aims her glowing wand at a mural on the Berlin Wall. A brilliant stream of pure color flows from her wand, hitting the wall and instantly dissolving a patch of ugly gray fog. The mural becomes intensely vibrant where the color touches it. Her parents watch from behind, their faces filled with awe and wonder.

**After:**
Noa kept humming, her heart soaring, as she mended the entire ribbon, chasing the last wisps of gray away. When she was done, the mural was brighter and more beautiful than ever.
