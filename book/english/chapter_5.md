# Chapter 5: Passports, Pretzels, and Painted Walls

The next day began at a place that felt like it was straight out of a spy movie: Checkpoint Charlie. Dad explained that this used to be the most famous crossing point between East and West Berlin. Now, it was a tourist spot with actors dressed as American soldiers and a replica of the guardhouse.

As her parents looked at the outdoor exhibits, Noa was approached by a beagle with a very serious expression. It sat at her feet like a soldier on duty.

“Alright, magician,” the beagle said, its voice a low bark. “Time for a real test. You need to learn a gateway spell. Not for opening doors, but for opening minds. The fog closes things down. You need to open them up.”

The beagle instructed her. She had to imagine a feeling of welcome, of safe passage. She held her wand and focused, whispering the German word for ‘welcome’: “*Willkommen*.”

Her first attempt was… sparkly. Instead of a feeling of welcome, a tiny, shimmering, five-pointed star appeared on the tip of her nose. She looked at her parents. They had them too. So did the beagle. And the tourist standing next to them. Everyone within ten feet suddenly had a tiny, glittering star stamped on their nose.

People started noticing, looking at each other and laughing. Soon, everyone was taking selfies with their sparkly noses. “Well, this is festive,” Ima said, examining her reflection in her phone.

Noa giggled. It was a mistake, but it was a happy one. She tried again, focusing harder on the feeling and not the sparkle. This time, she felt a gentle click in the air around her, like a lock opening. It wasn’t a big, flashy portal, but a subtle shift, a feeling that things were a little more open than they had been a moment before.

The beagle nodded, its nose-star twinkling. “Better. Much better. Now, you’d better get some lunch. A growing magician needs fuel.” It gave a little salute with its paw and trotted off.

Lunch was at Markthalle Neun, a huge indoor market hall built in 1891. It was loud, crowded, and smelled of everything delicious at once. There were stalls selling cheese, bread, sausages, and amazing-looking cakes. It reminded Noa of the Carmel Market in Tel Aviv, but with a different accent.

A little dachshund with the important air of a head chef scurried past her, its nose twitching.

“Ah, the *Große Zauberin*!” it yipped. “Here to learn the magic of the market?”

“The magic of the market?” Noa asked.

“Of course! It’s the most powerful magic of all: sharing,” said the dachshund. “The fog wants everyone to keep to themselves. But when you share food, you share stories. And that makes the whole city stronger.”

Noa decided to test the theory. She wanted to try a portion-multiplying spell on the giant pretzel her dad had bought, but she remembered the confetti dragon and the star-stamped noses. Maybe direct magic wasn’t the answer.

Instead, she just did it the old-fashioned way. She broke off a piece of her pretzel and gave it to her mom. She gave another piece to her dad. She saw a little boy looking at their pretzel with wide eyes, so she asked her dad if it was okay, and then she walked over and offered him a piece too. The boy’s mom smiled at her, a big, warm, grateful smile.

It was a small act, but the dachshund was right. It felt powerful. It was like with every bite she shared, the noisy, happy bubble of the market hall grew a little stronger, pushing back against the quiet, gray world of the fog.

Their last stop of the day was the most spectacular of all: the East Side Gallery. It was a long, long section of the Berlin Wall that was still standing, but now it was covered in paintings. Over a hundred murals by artists from all over the world stretched for more than a kilometer along the river Spree. It was an outdoor art gallery, a monument to peace.

Noa walked along, mesmerized by the colors and images. There were paintings of faces, of doves, of cars crashing through the wall. It was a storybook written on concrete.

Then she saw it. A patch of fog. It was thin and gray, clinging to one of the most famous murals, a painting of a long, colorful ribbon. The fog was making the colors look dull and faded, smudging the edges of the beautiful artwork.

This was it. Her first real fight.

She tried to brush the fog away with her hand, but it was like trying to catch smoke. She tried her polishing spell, but it did nothing. She even tried her new gateway spell, but the fog just swirled, unimpressed.

She felt a moment of panic. What if she couldn’t do it? But then she remembered Mauerpark. She remembered the beat that had brought everyone together. She looked at the painted ribbon, at its flowing, rhythmic lines. It was like a song.

She started to hum. It was the beat from the bucket drummers in the park. She held her wand like a conductor’s baton and traced the shape of the ribbon in the air, humming louder. She poured all her feelings into the sound—her love for the beautiful painting, her anger at the ugly fog, her hope for the city.

And the color answered.

A thread of bright, pure red lifted from the painting, glowing in the air. Then came blue, then yellow, then green. The colors wove themselves around her wand, following the rhythm of her humming. She wasn’t creating new colors; she was just reminding the old ones how to sing.

She aimed her wand at the wall and sent the colors streaming back into the mural. They hit the concrete with a soft *hiss*, and where they landed, the fog vanished. It didn’t just fade; it recoiled, pulling back from the vibrant, living color as if it had been burned.

Noa kept humming, her heart soaring, as she mended the entire ribbon, chasing the last wisps of gray away. When she was done, the mural was brighter and more beautiful than ever.

Her parents, who had been watching from a few feet away, just stared. Their mouths were open.

“Noa,” Dad said, his voice full of awe. “How… how did you do that?”

Before she could answer, a chorus of purrs rose from the riverbank. A group of cats was sitting on the grassy edge, watching her with glowing eyes.

“The final knots of the fog are hidden,” one of them called out, its voice clear in the suddenly still air. “They hide where water, trees, and stone remember.”

Water, trees, and stone. The triangle she had seen from the sky. Her mission was becoming clearer. She had won her first battle, but the war against the fog was not over yet.
