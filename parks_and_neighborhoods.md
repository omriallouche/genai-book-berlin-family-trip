## Tiergarten
**Description:**
Tiergarten is a prominent locality and a large urban park in central Berlin, Germany. The park, formally known as "Großer Tiergarten," covers 210 hectares (520 acres), making it one of the largest urban parks in Germany. It is often compared to New York's Central Park or London's Hyde Park, serving as Berlin's "green lung."

Originally a hunting ground for the Elector of Brandenburg dating back to 1527, Tiergarten was later transformed into a public park. It features tree-lined paths, open green spaces, sunbathing lawns, and a café and beer garden by a lake. The park is popular for leisurely strolls, picnics, jogging, cycling, and other outdoor activities.

Tiergarten is also home to many significant memorials and cultural sites. These include the Soviet War Memorial, the Victory Column (Siegessäule), the Bismarck Memorial, and the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (House of the World's Cultures). The park was severely damaged during World War II and largely deforested, but it has since been replanted and restored. The Berlin Zoological Garden and Aquarium are located in the southwest corner of the park.
