## East Side Gallery
**Description:**
The East Side Gallery in Berlin is a permanent open-air gallery located on the longest surviving section of the Berlin Wall. Situated on Mühlenstraße, between Berlin Ostbahnhof and the Oberbaumbrücke along the Spree, it stretches for 1,316 meters (4,318 ft). In the spring of 1990, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 118 artists from 21 countries painted murals directly onto the east side of the wall. These artworks comment on the political changes of 1989/1990, transforming the former barrier into a colorful memorial and the world's longest open-air gallery. Some of the most popular motifs include Dmitri Vrubel's "Fraternal Kiss" and Birgit Kinder's "Trabant breaking through the wall."

The East Side Gallery is considered a monument to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the peaceful negotiation of borders. It attracts millions of visitors annually and has official status as a heritage-protected landmark. While the original paintings from 1990 are no longer fully preserved due to urban development and weathering, replicas created in 2009 exist today. The Künstlerinitiative East Side Gallery e.V., an association of the artists involved, works to preserve and restore the artworks.

## Urban Nation
**Description:**
Urban Nation Berlin, officially known as the Urban Nation Museum for Urban Contemporary Art, is Germany's first museum dedicated to urban art. Located in a converted residential building in Berlin's Schöneberg district, it opened in 2017. The museum is an initiative of the non-profit Stiftung Berliner Leben, established in 2013 by the Gewobag housing association. Its core mission is to make street art, graffiti, and urban contemporary art accessible to a wide audience.

A distinctive feature of Urban Nation is its constantly evolving facade, which functions as a dynamic canvas for artists. These modular sections are regularly redesigned, replaced, and subsequently integrated into the museum's collection. The museum primarily showcases rotating exhibitions rather than a permanent collection. Urban Nation serves as a global platform for urban art, attracting both artists and visitors. It fosters creative exchange between artists and the local community, promoting integration and participation through cultural education programs. The institution also includes the Martha Cooper Library, which focuses on street art and graffiti, and an artist-in-residence program called Fresh A.I.R., providing studio apartments for participating artists.

Beyond its walls, Urban Nation has contributed to Berlin's urban landscape by facilitating the creation of numerous large and small-scale murals across the city since 2013, featuring works by renowned artists. Its overarching goals are to preserve the history of urban art, nurture new talent, and enhance community engagement.
