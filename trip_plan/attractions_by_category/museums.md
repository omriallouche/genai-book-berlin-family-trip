## ANOHA – The Children's World of the Jewish Museum Berlin

**Description:**
ANOHA – The Children's World of the Jewish Museum Berlin is an interactive museum specifically designed for children aged three to ten, with a central focus on the story of Noah's Ark from the Torah. Opened on June 27, 2021, it is uniquely located in a former flower market hall directly opposite the main Jewish Museum Berlin building, providing a distinct and engaging environment for young visitors.

The museum's centerpiece is a massive, circular wooden ark, approximately 7 meters (23 feet) tall and 28 meters (92 feet) in diameter, designed by American architect Alan Maskin and his team from Olson Kundig. Inside and around this impressive ark, there are over 150 animal sculptures. Each of these sculptures is a work of art, crafted by various artists from recycled and everyday objects such as footballs, floor lamps, and ship oars. Children are actively encouraged to interact with these tactile sculptures by touching, climbing, feeding, and caring for them, promoting themes of recycling, adaptive reuse, and the importance of respecting global resources.

ANOHA offers numerous interactive exhibits and play stations where children can engage with the Noah's Ark narrative through hands-on experiences. These activities include building their own ark, navigating a water course, redesigning the future, and even composing a water concert. The museum aims to foster creativity, imagination, and a sense of hope and possibility, encouraging children to think about respectful coexistence between humans, animals, and nature, inspired by the Jewish concept of "tikkun olam" (making the world a little bit better). The design incorporates sustainable strategies and provides an immersive environment for discovery, exploration, and play, with a focus on allowing children to take the initiative. The museum also involves children in its development through a children's advisory committee. General admission to ANOHA is free, with specific tours for adults without children available for a fee.
