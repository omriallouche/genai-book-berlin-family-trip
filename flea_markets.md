## Boxhagener Platz
**Description:**
The Boxhagener Platz flea market in Berlin is a large market held every Sunday in the heart of the vibrant student quarter of Friedrichshain, near Simon-Dach-Strasse. It's a popular spot for both locals and tourists to browse and find treasures. The market offers a wide variety of second-hand goods, including books, records, furniture, household equipment, fashion, clothes, bags, paintings, and decorative objects. It's particularly known for its many book and record stalls. While it's large enough to offer good variety, it's considered smaller and less overwhelming than some other Berlin flea markets like Mauerpark or Trödelmarkt Straße des 17. Juni, and is often less crowded. Many of the stalls are professionally run, meaning that while you can find unique items, great bargains on certain items might be less common.

The market is situated around a small park, with numerous cafes and restaurants in the immediate vicinity, making it a good place to combine a visit with a Sunday brunch. The central meadow in the square also provides a place to relax after shopping. The market operates from 10 AM to 6 PM on Sundays, weather permitting.
